# MoE Bar Replacer
World of Tanks MoE French/British Bar replacer.

# What this mod does:

Changes the MoE stars and hatchets and little stripes (from the Czech line) into bars like the French, British and Swedish marks. 

I have use the standard white bars for the US line, and I have edited them to be in the Japanese/Russian and Chinese colours - red with black for JPN/RU and red with yellow for China. It also changes the Czech MoEs to the German ones as I feel they look better than the silly double lines. I may eventually do a version where I extended the double lines like the normal bars so it keeps with the standard Czech look.

# Installation:

Created on 0.9.19.1. Should work on 0.9.19.1.1 (pending testing, but it always works whenever I just move it to the new game version).

I have made a .wotmod as well as included the regular res\_mods folder for those who want to fiddle.

I have also included scripts for the T110E5 and 59 Patton which move the MoE to where I feel WG should put them. I will include a how-to on how to change this for your favourite tank too.

If any errors occur in your game after installing this modification, please try uninstalling the mod. If the game does not continue to function after uninstalling, please try re-installing the game

Do not attempt to modify this further unless you know what you are doing, or are willing to reinstall the game (if it comes to it).
