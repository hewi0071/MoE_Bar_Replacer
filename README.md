# MoE_Bar_Replacer
World of Tanks MoE French/British Bar replacer.

#What this mod does:

Changes the MoE stars and hatchets and little stripes (from the Czech line) into bars like the French, British and Swedish marks. 

I have use the standard white bars for the US line, and I have edited them to be in the Japanese/Russian and Chinese colours - red with black for JPN/RU and red with yellow for China. It also changes the Czech MoEs to the German ones as I feel they look better than the silly double lines. I may eventually do a version where I extended the double lines like the normal bars so it keeps with the standard Czech look.

#Installation:

Extract the zip archive. Copy the game version folder from the extracted files into the res_mods folder of your World of Tanks installed directory. This is usually C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\res_mods, but can literally be anywhere you chose when you installed/copied the game. When the game updates, i.e. I have included both 0.9.17.0 and 0.9.17.0.1. I am on the SEA server, and we didn't get the 0.1 hotfix for 9.17.0. Thus, this is only tested on 0.9.17.0.

If any errors occur in your game after installing this modification, please try uninstalling the mod. If the game does not continue to function after uninstalling, please try re-installing the game

Do not attempt to modify this further unless you know what you are doing, or are willing to reinstall the game (if it comes to it).

I do not own or claim to own any of the content in this mod. I edited the files provided by Wargaming with Paint.net from http://www.getpaint.net/index.html

I take no responsibility for any errors that occur before or after you install this mod.

#Untested:

I haven't seen anyone with a MoE from the Czech lines, so I cannot confirm whether they work or not as I have not marked any of my own tanks from that nation.
